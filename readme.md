#This is my final project for TypeScript mooc.

**Thanks for your effort to evaluate my work.**

## application organization
This is directly derived from previous modules. I have organized the code using 3 classes:

* app.ts
  Contains application initalization, JSON loader, and select change event.

* painter.ts
  Contains classes for handling Painter, PainterInformation and PainterExamples.

* render.ts
  Contains classes for rendering objects


## Result
